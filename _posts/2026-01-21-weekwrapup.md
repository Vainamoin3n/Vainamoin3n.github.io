## A weekly wrap-up that keeps me grounded
About a year and a half ago, I started a small habit: every Friday, I write a short wrap-up of my week.
The goal was simple: understand where my time actually went, capture what I learned, and see if I could improve my focus.
Over time, it became one of the most reliable routines I have for reflecting and improving how I work.

## How I do it
Every Friday, I copy a template and fill it in. I start by reviewing my calendar and notes, then I write a quick day-by-day recap. At the end, I maintain a small task list for next week.
I deliberately avoid customer and colleague names. That way, if I later summarize it with AI, I am not risking leaking sensitive information.

## The format I use
I iterated on a few versions over time. This is the one I currently use:

> ## Weekly Work Wrap-Up
>
> 1. **Date and mood**
>    - Date: (Today’s date, usually Friday’s)
>    - Mood at the time of writing: (How I feel as I start writing)
>
> 2. **Summary of the week**
>    - Overview: (What mattered this week)
>    - Major accomplishments: (Things I or my team succeeded at, delivery or people-related)
>    - Challenges faced: (Issues I faced, delivery or people-related)
>
> 3. **Daily breakdown**
>    - **Monday**
>      - Key tasks and activities: (Main activities based on my calendar)
>      - Important meetings and outcomes:
>        - (Meeting title)
>          - (Outcome and/or action points)
>      - Decisions and learnings:
>        - (Decisions or learnings likely to matter later)
>
>    - **Tuesday**
>      - Key tasks and activities:
>      - Important meetings and outcomes:
>      - Decisions and learnings:
>
>    - **Wednesday**
>      - Key tasks and activities:
>      - Important meetings and outcomes:
>      - Decisions and learnings:
>
>    - **Thursday**
>      - Key tasks and activities:
>      - Important meetings and outcomes:
>      - Decisions and learnings:
>
>    - **Friday**
>      - Key tasks and activities:
>      - Important meetings and outcomes:
>      - Decisions and learnings:
>
> 4. **Goals and tasks for next week**
>    - Key goals and tasks:
>      - (This becomes my running task list, see [Benefit 5](#benefit-5-it-became-my-task-list))
>
> 5. **Reflections**
>    - What went well:
>    - What could be improved:
>    - Overall satisfaction and takeaways:
>      - (This is often different from the mood at the start, in both good and bad ways)
>
> 6. **Additional notes**
>    - (Rarely used, but useful for links or context I want to keep)


## Benefit 1: Continuity into the next week
On Monday, I read the previous wrap-up. It immediately restores context: what was happening, what mattered, and what I intended to do next.
It is a simple way to avoid spending Monday morning reconstructing Friday.

## Benefit 2: Closure before the weekend
Before I started doing this, I often carried unresolved work thoughts into the weekend.
The wrap-up gives my brain a place to “park” everything: what happened, what is pending, and what I will do next. Once it is written, it is much easier to mentally switch off.

## Benefit 3: A personal retrospective
Retrospectives work for teams because they create learning loops. A weekly wrap-up does something similar at an individual level.
It forces a small moment of reflection: what actually happened, what went well, what did not, and what I want to change going forward. Over time, those small adjustments compound.

## Benefit 4: Input for Personal Development conversations
At Eficode, we had a Personal Development Talk (PDT) every six months. I tried an experiment: I gave a custom GPT my weekly wrap-ups for the period as content, then fed it the PDT questions.

What I noticed:
- My own answers were heavily biased toward the last 2 to 3 weeks.
- The GPT produced more balanced answers across the whole period.
- It was also good at spotting patterns over time (mood shifts, recurring challenges, and how earlier decisions and learnings played out later).
I still prefer writing the template myself first, but I then use the custom GPT to cross-check and refine what I wrote.

## Benefit 5: It became my task list
I quickly realized that keeping my to-do list at the bottom of the weekly wrap-up was an easy way to keep it alive.
Throughout the week, I add tasks, planned or unplanned, and keep the list up to date. When I complete an item, I strike it through instead of deleting it.
At the end of the week, this makes it easy to see progress, whether the list is growing, and what I should prioritize next. During reflection, forgotten tasks often surface naturally and can be captured immediately.

## If you try it
If you want to test the habit, start small. Put a 15-minute calendar block on Friday about one hour before you finish work, and treat it as a non-negotiable review.
A few colleagues adopted the same routine after I shared it internally, and it stuck for them as well. If you do try it, I would be interested to hear what format you end up with.
