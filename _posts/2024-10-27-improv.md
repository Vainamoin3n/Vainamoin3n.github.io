## The Improv mindset for Product Managers: Say 'Yes, And' to Better Products

Product managers are the connectors, listeners, and storytellers at the heart of a product’s journey. Interestingly, many of the qualities essential to successful product management—like empathy, adaptability, and openness—are also foundational in improvisational theater. 
In this post, I’ll share some of my insights on how applying improv principles has directly impacted my journey as a PM.

### "Yes, And" – Embracing and Building Upon Ideas
- In Improv: The "Yes, and" principle is the first concept to learn in improv. Early our improv teachers told us to play a game where one came up with as many ideas as possible and the other's entire role was to say no. The experience of powerlessness and annoyance was strong enough that I recall it, years later. In improv, "Yes, and" is what enables the actor to build together, and a mastery of it gives life to the scene.
- For PMs: Product managers thrive on information. "Yes, and" helps you welcome ideas and insights, wherever they come from, without judgment and build upon them constructively. Whether the idea or insight is backed up at the point doesn't matter, because in the eyes of the person gifting you the information, it is correct and, as a pm, you have to make a duty to accept it as a data point.

### Overlistening – Going Beyond Active Listening
- In Improv: Improvisers listen deeply, tuning into not only what their partners are saying but also how they say it, noticing subtle cues, emotions, and body language that shape the scene.
- For PMs: Overlistening means taking in all the cues (tone, body language, ..) given to you, rather than simply responding to what is said. By tuning into the nuances of feedback, the body language from users, engineers, or stakeholders, you can anticipate challenges, uncover hidden needs, and respond more effectively to the goals of others. In a recent meeting, I noticed slight changes in body language in an introverted colleague. By inviting them to speak up, they shared a key insight we might have otherwise missed

### Putting Yourself in Others’ Shoes – Assuming Best Intent
- In Improv: I was taught long form improvisation, where the goal is to build a character over the scenes and come to "think" through that character. Given their current mood and values, how do I react to the information that is given to me. This is yet another powerful skill to build rich and believable scenes.
- For PMs: PMs work with diverse teams with varying priorities and perspectives. By putting yourself in others' shoes—be it an engineer’s, a customer's, or a stakeholder’s—you foster collaboration and a positive atmosphere, which is essential for navigating conflicting priorities effectively.

### The PM at the Intersection of Worlds - A Logical Chaos
- In Improv: An improviser’s role is to connect with others on stage, creating a shared narrative that’s cohesive and engaging, no matter how diverse the characters or plot points.
- For PMs: You sit at the crossroads of business goals, customer problems, company environment challenges and technical capabilities. The ability to seamlessly switch between different mindsets, see information through different angles enables you to take the decisions that your organization expects of you.

### From Gatekeeper to Trusted Partner – Building Collaborative Relationships
- In Improv: Improv only works when actors trust one another, making it safe to share ideas without fear of judgment. This trust enables actors to take creative risks and make the scene stronger.
- For PMs: PMs are often viewed as “gatekeepers” of product decisions. By fostering an environment of trust and adopting a collaborative mindset, you can shift this perception and become trusted partners. Rather than simply approving or rejecting ideas, you work with your team to shape ideas, build consensus, and encourage open dialogue. In my team, we used to have all hands workshop to hear everyone point on everything. When my team grew too large for everyone to be directly involved, we created a ‘product trio’ approach. This trio gathered insights from all team members to make well-rounded, collective decisions.

### Embracing Failure and Iteration
- In Improv: Failure is an integral part of the creative process. Improvisers learn to embrace mistakes and use them to fuel new directions for scenes. One of the first things we learn from the teacher was: "Whatever you say or do, it was the right thing to do". When building with others, even if you don't see where to go from where you are, it doesn't mean that others don't :) .
- For PMs: Building product is all about reducing risks (Value, Usability, Feasibility, Business viability). Despite all our effort to reduce risks, failed experiements will happen (Over 50% In Apple, Microsoft, ...). And failure is a critical learning tool, helping you learn, iterate and build toward success.

### Staying Present
- In Improv: Improvisers excel by staying in the moment, fully present with their scene partners, and responsive to what’s happening in real-time rather than planning ahead.
- For PMs: Product management is fast-paced and unpredictable. Staying present helps you remain adaptable and make decisions based on the learnings rather than getting attached to long-term assumptions. Nothing irks me more than stories of teams refusing learnings because they are already building and management wants the project to be launched.

### Cultivating Creative Confidence
- In Improv: Confidence is key in improv. Actors step onto the stage with limited information, relying on their instincts and trust in the process to create something impactful.
- For PMs: One of my favorite mottos is 'Strong opinions, loosely held'—a reminder to champion decisions confidently but be open to change as new insights emerge. No one follows an indecisive leader, so remaining unsure is also not an option for a PM.

### Mastering Non-Verbal Communication
- In Improv: Improvisers convey a lot without words—through body language, facial expressions, and tone—enhancing their connection with both the audience and their scene partners.
- For PMs: Non-verbal cues are equally important in product management. The introverted colleague example earlier is a clear case of this. It’s vital to be mindful of your own body language as well, as it's very easy to pass the wrong message, inadvertantly. Especially if, like me, you have a body language that may not be exactly the same as everyone's ;) .

### Sharpening Storytelling Skills
- In Improv: At its core, improv is about crafting a story that resonates with the audience, even if created on the fly. Successful improvisers ensure their scenes have structure, character, and purpose.
- For PMs: Storytelling is essential for you, as you must communicate the product vision and align teams around it. Effective storytelling skills help rally support, explain complex ideas, and connect with users. Whether presenting to stakeholders or motivating teams, your strong storytelling skills can inspire a shared sense of purpose and excitement.

## Conclusion: Why an Improv Mindset Makes Better PMs

Improv helps you become a better person. Storytelling, confidence, listening and building with others is something that I have noticed getting better at during my years studying improv.
All the points of the article are what make me believe that I'm a better fit for the role thanks to Improve. Other seem to have noticed its strength too, especially when advice on how to be a better PM appear being direct improv exercise.
If you want to get started, I would recommend a beginner friendly group (In Helsinki, ["Not A Hospital"](https://www.facebook.com/notahospital/) is a free group that hosts beginner friendly sessions regularly) or even better take classes (I took mine at ["Improv Helsinki"](https://www.improhelsinki.com/) and I can't vouch more for their AWESOMENESS).
