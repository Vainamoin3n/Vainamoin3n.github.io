## Objective and Key Results (OKRs) without strategy

This is part 4 of "Teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea", a series on different ways to align an organisation.
You will find the part 1 of the series [here](https://www.productmusings.fi/posts/alignment1/), part 2 [here](https://www.productmusings.fi/posts/alignment2/) and part 3 [here](https://www.productmusings.fi/posts/alignment3/)

- In the first part we looked at an organization that is drifting without clear direction, led by the customers' requests.
- In the second part we looked at command and control management style, where the management hires mercenaries to execute their orders.
- In the third part we looked at a strategy that doesn't focus anything, leading to a low alignment between colleagues and units.

In this fourth part we apply google's OKR framework but we do not have a strategy in place for the company yet.
Objective and Key Results (OKRs) is an alignment tool where the whole company collaborates to define objectives (yearly and quarterly) and the way to measure progress on those (Key Results).
Key results are written as measurable outcomes that progress as we become closer to the objective completion. 
I've put a very complete read on the subject by Itamar Gilar at the bottom of this post.

## OKR created without long term strategy

### Situation: Some mission/vision, strategy is not existing, okrs used instead of strategy

The OKR framework is a really powerful tool to align everyone across the company.
This is partly due to the fact that it is used both top-down and bottom-up, so everyone gets heard on what do we aim and how do we measure it.

What I have seen done are yearly objectives (1-year timespan) and quarterly objectives (3 months timespan). It's always been that yearly are there first and maybe there would be quarterly ones.

Now the issue about this is that 1 year is a very short time when working on a product. Usually you want a Product Strategy to cover 2 to 5 years, but what if your organization plans only for the next year?


### Successes:

OKRs, if done correctly, provide a good alignment for the coming year. Key Results evaluated monthly allow for quick pivoting of initiatives.

Sales, Marketing, HR can correctly set objectives related to their functions:
- Human Resources usually want to keep employees happy, churn low and have skilled candidates in the pipeline.
- Marketing will put objectives on building more visibility on what the company can do for its customers.
- Sales can aim for more sales, newer markets (with marketing)

### Difficulties:

Problems arise when we arrive to product/tech. 
While other functions can be fine taking a tactical approach, and be relatively successful with it, tech needs to think further.

This is inherently due to the fact that building something valuable is very slow. With modern discovery techniques, one can find potential value fairly fast, but then iteratively building and validating is a fairly slow process.
Building a product for 1 year and then changing objectives? At this point you barely have started delivering something valuable to customers.
The product strategy is likely to aim at a lot longer term (5-8 years) than the OKRs and than means you can't exactly align to it, more like feature choices may get influenced by the OKRs.

It gets more complicated when the products mature. Now your engineers want to rebuild one of the core elements and predict a few months of work.
If your objectives cover just 1 year, good luck defending the value of a refactoring operation that will take a few months ^^. Add to this that any significant issue not dealt with on time, gets more difficult to deal with, and you have a great recipe for a disaster.

One could ignore this risks and do fine for a while, but as the market evolves, so should your product. 
A PM from Helsinki recently shared a story in a product meetup about a company running on "catching the next sale" for years and ending up struggling to sell anything as the competition got far ahead and the value of the product not following.

Engineers love finding solutions to problems. When giving them the long term direction, they will get a lot of ideas on what could be tried and done. If the opportunity is not there, you are missing out.


### Possible ways to improve:

Honestly, the only way I see is to start thinking longer term and introduce a longer term strategy.

It shouldn't be such a big leap from planning the OKRs. There probably were discussions on what do we aim for on the long term during the OKRs planning, and the agreements that emerged are good building material for a strategy.
Now agreeing on a common strategy is gonna be hard, because everyone around the table is having different desires. But if the company is going to align to one direction properly, there is no going around it.



### Employee experience: 

A few issues may arise:
- "I have no idea where we are going and why this is important" => 	Lack of direction, disconnect between goals and purposes
- "I feel that the management doesn't trust me to know more" => I'm not a valuable employee enough, I'm not trusted enough to be in the known
- "My unit is doing good, everything is fine" => Unfortunately, as I told in part 1, a company is a team game, and it succeeds as well as its weakest link. If you are doing good but the ones around you aren't, then you are failing as a whole.
