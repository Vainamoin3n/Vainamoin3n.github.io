In this post I talk about the impact of a product designer, on a product team.
This is taken directly from my personal experience and I'm not using any AIs to make the post (maybe I should ;) )

## Understanding the big why

The role of PM is usually fairly lonely. jack of all trades master of none, connected to all units but part of none, you are in a unique position that enables you to get glimpses of the right direction for your product.  
You do that by studying the market, running interviews, reflecting on the available data, talking to your colleagues around the coffee machine, ...

Sometimes, if you are lucky, you'll get a companion: a team lead, a scrum master, an interested developer, a QA engineer...
If you are really luck though, you get an ally: The product designer.

I'm not downplaying the other companions here, they are a very big help and will always bring something extra to the work.
But none of them is as close to you when it comes to understanding the big "why?".

## Draw it to me like a 3 years old

I've been working in my current workplace for 1 year now.  
Before working there, I had never seen a product designer at work. Sure when I needed some graphical assets, a colleague skilled in UI would produce something nice but that was it. 
All my designs were Miro made, with my "exceptional" drawing and information organization skills. The developers would silently suffer what I produced, add their own touch to it and the customer would help us improve it with their feedback.

## Overlapping interests

When I started to work at my current workplace that I met Camille, the product designer in my team. 
It didn't take long before we both realized that we would need to interact ... a lot.

It became blatant when planning the first round of interviews. We both thought it part of our respective role to organize and run the interviews.  
It is critical for a product manager to to deeply understand the customers personas, their pains, their delighters, their goals to be able to find the right problems to solve.

So naturally, Camille was the one running the research in the team before I came, and I was running the research process in my previous team.

We sat down, aligned and established the first version of how research was to be run in the team.

## Information sharing on sterioids

One of the strongest skill of a product designer is information organization.
That means that in our team, Camille is responsible of the visual content of anything we produce.  
It includes thinking, prototyping and refining the User Experience of any product we work one but not only.
Our product designer is also responsible of:
- Presentation slides
- Internal marketing visuals (and also partly external)
- Memo reports
- ...

While these extra are not the most challenging tasks for a product designer, it sets a really high standard for the team.
It also ignites design-centricity in-and-out the product, getting colleagues outside of the team to pay more attention to the user experience they provide.

## Product management impact

Having a product designer in my team has changed the way I work quite a lot.  
Slide decks: For example when I need to present something to stakeholders, I make a slideset made of mostly blank slides containing rectangles of what message I would want to pass in each slide, as what is the content idea I have.
Camille will take that as an input and make the deck the best possible to improve our chances of the message coming across. 

Marketing efforts: we just put somewhere for whom is it, what purpose, what ideas and he will make the right visual for it.

Interviews: we will decide early what we want to get out of interviews at the moment, and whom internally should we also interview. From there, he will design the question set, and run the interviews while I and one of the developers usually take notes and ask extra questions.

As Camille explained it in our recent retrospective, he feels that he is in between 2 worlds, one of business requirements, higher level understanding of where we are going and why and one of going to the nitty gritty details of what a mouse over does on each component and what function it has when you click.
And while it's the PM'a role to make sure everyone is aligned on the problems to be solved, the impact we want to have and the requirements, the designer is in a very good place to reinforce that understanding with their daily interactions with all the team members.


## When should you have a product designer in your team

As said earlier, before my current workplace, I used to organize the research and do most of the visuals by myself. It kinda worked out, and with the user's feedback we eventually reached something usable.
It just took a lot more time to get to a usable solution.

We are leaving in the world of the [red queen race](https://medium.com/think-big-work-smart/it-takes-all-the-running-you-can-do-to-keep-in-the-same-place-ee1672c4b769), if you don't find the right problems and solutions, you become irrelevant.
You cannot afford a long time to find a good solution, a [usable, feasible, business viable, valuable and ethical solution] (https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).

So as early as possible, invest in product design. 

The PM/Product Designer due allows, not only to find right problems to tackle, but also deliver relevant solutions generating business value, nurturing premium user experience and fostering customer-centricity.

In our team, we have had a full time product designer as early as there were 2 software engineers (and the product manager was part time then).
I don't have enough experience to tell you if it was the right time, but at least right now it's so that Camille has a bit of slack and so do I.

Some entreprise have Product Design as a service, same as research as a service, but I have not had such experience before. 
At least I can tell that having a product designer dedicated to the team has felt right so far, and I don't think it would be doable with less time and involvment.

The PM/Product Designer duo allows, not only to find right problems to tackle, but also deliver relevant solutions generating business value, nurturing premium user experience and fostering customer-centricity.
