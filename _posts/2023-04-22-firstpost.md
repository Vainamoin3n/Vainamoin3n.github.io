A simple post to introduct myself.

# My work values

I could probably write a whole article on my work experience (and I did ^^ but I erased it).  
Fortunately for you, I'd rather keep it short and tell that I have been through QA, backend dev, team leadership, customer success, project management and currently am happy in product management.  
Now these titles don't necessarily reflect what I exactly did, but hey, working in small companies forces you to be quite versatile, and be where you are needed.  
if you want to see what I've done and where I've been, here is [my Linked in profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clément-louarn-finland) .

One thing that I can expand on though is my work philosophy.  
So far what I've resonated most with have been working in a bottom-up culture where I can have an impact on things beyond my role description.
I love giving and receiving feedback, open mindedness (Listen to what I have to say, and take it into account, even if your final decision is different), and collaboration.  
I work at my best when surrounded by people with whom I can discuss issues, bounce back ideas and overall challenge my thoughts and conceptions in a respectful way.
An environment where people are very different from each other but share some base values such as respect, transparency and proactiveness is where you will see me bloom.  
Interesting that my work ethic is quite close to the Agile values :).

I'm very lucky with my current workplace (Eficode) and team: they are fitting really well the description above.

# Outside of work

Well I would say that my biggest hobby is my son. Usually if I have free time, I'm going to spend it with him .

If he is not available (or I don't have the energy :) ), I will play some video games (Currently Rocket league and Spiritfarer), read some books (currently "Continuous Discovery Habits" by Theresa Torres and I just finished the last trilogy of Joe Abercrombie) or do pling pling on my kantele (I have no idea how to play it but it's very pleasant to try to).

I'm also an avid listener of music. The style I listen to change but a staple is folk music, from various parts of the world.
One artist has become a staple in the past years though: [Gealdýr](https://www.gealdyr.com/). I find that whatever mood I am in, listening to his music is the right thing to do.

Oh and one hobby of mine is also Improvisation Theater. I used to be part of "Improv Helsinki" until they had to close their doors (Yey Covid, but they reopened again!). Since then, my group and I have contracted a teacher [Anna Korolainen-Crevier](http://annakorolainencrevier.com/) to keep teaching us. So far so very good.  
What I really love about Improvisation Theater is how impactful its philosophy is, at work and in life in general. I will definitely write more on that later.

# Why this blog

I've been considering writing about my experience and thoughts for quite a while but always ended up with these 2 conclusions:
- The subjects I would write about have nothing innovative to them => I'm not helping anyone with them
- Who am I to think that writing what I did or think would interest anyone?

A few colleagues (The A&C crew, I will tell more about them later) told me that it's not about yourself but rather about giving your version about the subjects and enriching the collective with that experience.
Even if no one ends up reading it, it helps you to clarify you thoughts.  
So here I am. trying to add a drop of alternative experience to the collective of knowledge.
Hopefully I will manage to keep you entertained during the trip.
