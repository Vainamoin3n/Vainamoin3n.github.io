## An interesting game

![A hat game](/assets/img/hatgame.png)

My colleague Tatu KÃ¤iri came up with an interesting mind game on one Friday afternoon.

The rules are so:

>You are a starting a new product idea and you need a team to work on it.
>You cannot work on the product yourself.  
>Which employee first: A Product Manager, a software engineeer, a Designer, a QA person, an ops person, a marketeer or a salesperson.
>Once you have the first hire, after a while you get a budget for 2, whom do you get then? then 3rd and so on.
{: .prompt-info }

Sure it's a game that probably wouldn't work in reality but it's fun to discuss with a few colleague, to understand their view on software development.

Personally, it got me to think that all specializations are about risk reduction, which I want to expand on.

## It's all about risks

I wonder what was your first choice?
Our group reached a conclusion that the software engineer is probably our first hire, because they are the only ones actually able to produce value for the customer.
Though the age of AI, more and more tools allow you to build working software by describing prompting it, so there is a case to be made for the PM bein first too.

What the game got me to think about though, was that, around the software engineer, all the other roles are there to reduce risks.
- The product manager? Their role is to take a strong stance in reducing the Value Risk and the Business Value Risk.
- The Designer? Through their UX design and research they look at Value risk, Usability risk
- The QA? Challenging the developers before and during development, testing or building tools for testing with help a lot with Usability risk
- The Ops? Making sure that the software built can be run and can handle customer using it sound like Feasibility risk with a touch of Usability/Value risk too
- The Marketeer? What if your product is never discovered? How do you make sure you have the right qualities highlighted? Value risk, Business Value risk, "Sellability" risk
- The Salesperson? Reaching out, selling and maintaining a healthy relationship with customers goes to "Sellability" risk, Value risk

Even the software engineer plays a frontline role in reducing the feasibility risk.

I'm sure asking someone else to fill these would give variation in the answers but, hopefully, you get the idea and that's what matters.

## The real world doesn't work like that

Surely, the real world doesn't work like that. Every employee is far more than a title, their skills, personality, interests covering a lot more that the job description.
But one thing is true: The less people in the team the more risks each has to cover.

The game is still a fun one to think with your team:
- How do they view their role in the team?
- What do they feel their contribution to be?
- Find out if a risk coverage is only covered by one person (Imagine if they get sick!)

If I apply it to my current team, every risk is spread across multiple members. Sure Business Value risk is more of a central topic for me, but the team's product designer (Camille) and the team's team lead (Veneta) are often helping me if not doing themselves the Business Viability Risk reducing.
Feasibility is a bit harder though, as it has a high technical skill requirement that mostly Software Engineers / Devops possess. 

One could argue, why not build a whole team of Software Engineers then, if at the start they are able to cover everything, to a certain degree.
Well sure but naturally people will tend to specialise in what they are good at. So you'll end up with an engineer or a set of engineers doing product management, another doing design and, in the end, you'll end up with specialists dedicated to the craft just with a software engineer title :) 

## Try it out!

I recommend you to try the game at the lunch table and see how others think about it. Share your findings in the Linked in post comments?

When growing you team, I would vouch for not hyperspecializing the members to cover only certain areas as it completely kills the team members ability to understand the other's constraints. Silos, anyone?
Rather spread the risks across and make sure that they are all well covered.

## Read more about product risks
If you haven't yet, I highly recommend to read the Product Management bible "Inspired" by Marty Cagan.
Taken from it, and used for this post are the 4 big risks. Here is a link to a blogpost about them:
