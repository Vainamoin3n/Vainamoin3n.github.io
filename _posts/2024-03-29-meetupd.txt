## The opening window effect

Working as a product person can be mind numbing. Constantly trying to find better value for the customer in ways that work for the business, at high speed, can easily make you stuck in your ways, simply because no time for improving. (Hello square wheel)
I've already talked about one way to challenge this, [with the help of one's mentors](https://www.productmusings.fi/posts/mentors/). 
Today I talk about another, the industry meetups.

The industry meetups are regular events, organized by volunteers or organizations, usually to speak about a specific topic.
You can find them in many flavors: in the morning (breakfast), in the evening (afterwork) or fullday, with speakers or without (group discussion/ un-conference), public or invite-only, monthly or yearly.
They all share 2 common themes: Getting the participants to learn about a topic and enable them to network

## Reflecting on the main topic(s)

Usually in most meetups I've been to, the organizers will have a few speakers to talk about specific topics.
For meetups, unlike conferences, the speakers are usually volunteers, willing to share of their experience on the topic for free.
Sometimes you ll get an influencer in your domain, sometimes you'll get someone sharing a piece of their worklife story.
Everytime, you will get to reflect on what you are (or not) doing on the specific topic. Plenty of learning opportunities ahead :) .

An important point here is: dare asking your questions. The benefit is both for your sake and for the speaker to clarify a point that they might not have covered well.

## Networking

Probably the most important part of the meetup is networking. It's sometimes kind of a mix bag, especially in public meetups, since you never really know who you are going to meet there.
Usually though, if people have decided to dedicate some of their personal time to take part in the event, they are people with a desire to learn and you cannot go wrong in meeting people with this trait.
Now I have to admit that talking to perfect strangers is a difficult part for me, even after years of participation. I'm an introvert by nature and it takes a lot of my energy.
But the rewards are worth the incomfort.

Tips:
- Add people on linked in. Use the scan feature of Linked in (!!!!! add picture) to save time
- Dare contact the people you meet after the meetup (Most people I have met have welcome the talk)
- Get introduced to others by the people you already know.

## How do you find meetups?

As said before there are many flavors and they use very different channels.
One good starting point are the websites: Meetup.com (more community driven, usually free) and Eventbrite.com (more commercially driven, sometimes free)
Once you start knowing people, you are likely to get invited to more restricted whatsapp or telegram group where the events circulate more easily. Usually they are open but without easy visibility (only on the organizing company newsfeed for example).
Having organizers in your Linkedin network is also a good way to keep up to date with the events happening.
