## Fighting the Echo chamber

Working as a product person can be mind numbing. Constantly trying to find better value for the customer in ways that work for the business, at high speed, can easily make you stuck in your ways, simply because there's no time for improving (Hello square wheel :) ).
I've already talked about one way to challenge this: [with the help of one's mentors](https://www.productmusings.fi/posts/Mentors/). 
Today I talk about another, the industry meetups. This one is best at inspiring you to think outside your current work environment and limits, where all colleagues think and act similar to you: your echo chamber.

## What is a meetup

Industry meetups are regular events, organized by volunteers or organizations, usually to speak about a specific topic or interest.
They come in many flavors: in the morning (breakfast), in the evening (afterwork) or fullday, with speakers or without (group discussion/ un-conference), public or invite-only, monthly or yearly.
2 common themes are omnipresent though: Getting the participants to learn about a topic and enable them to network.

## Reflecting on the main topic(s)

Usually in most meetups I've been to, the organizers will have (a) speaker(s) to talk about a specific theme for that day.
For meetups, unlike conferences, the speakers are usually volunteers, willing to share of their experience on the topic for free.
Sometimes you'll get an influencer in your domain, sometimes you'll get someone sharing a piece of their worklife story.
Everytime, you will get to reflect on what you are (or not) doing on the specific topic. Plenty of learning opportunities ahead :) .

An important point here is: dare asking your questions. The benefit is both for your sake and for the speaker to clarify a point that they might not have covered well.

## Networking

Probably the most important part of the meetup is networking. It's sometimes kind of a mix bag, especially in public meetups, since you never really know who you are going to meet there.
Usually though, if people have decided to dedicate some of their personal time to take part in the event, they are people with a desire to learn and you cannot go wrong in meeting people with this trait.
Now I have to admit that talking with perfect strangers can be daunting. Even after years of participation, it still takes effort for me to start conversations.
But the rewards are worth the incomfort.

Tips:
- Get introduced to others by the people you already know. It helps breaking the first contact more easily. Organizers can give you a hand with that too, just ask them :) .
- Add people as new contacts on LinkedIn. That's one of the artifacts of your network growing and makes you more memorable in people's heads. I can't count the times when I used LinkedIn to recall the name of a person I met.
- Reach out to the people you meet after the meetup. Most people I have met have welcome the talk, and it makes for great lunch dates.

## How do you find meetups?

As said before there are many flavors and they use very different channels.
One good starting point are the websites: [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) (more community driven, usually free) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) (more commercially driven, sometimes free).
In these website you can search by city and keywords to find the meetups that are programmed to happen or meetup groups.
Many meetup groups gather only a few times or a year or less often so check when the few last events happened to see if the group is active.

Once you start knowing people, you are likely to get invited to more restricted whatsapp or telegram group where more private events circulate as well. More often than not these events are open, but placed in rather obscure places (only on the organizing company newsfeed for example).
Having organizers in your Linkedin network is also a good way to keep up to date with when events happen.

## Speaking in meetups

One good way to get to gaining exposure for personal branding and get your current knowledged challenged is to talk on stage in a meetup.
Not only does it actually work but you also get to improve your public speaking team at the same.
And you don't necessarily have to be the best expert on a topic, just have a story to share, yours.

The best way for it to happen is usually to contact the organizers (in person works better) and to tell them what you would able to talk about.
They most likely will put you in a backlog of possible speakers and reach out when they have an event that would fit you.

## Organizing meetups

I've personally been organizing the Product Tank Helsinki for a while now.
I haven't started it, so I can't say for sure how hard it would be, but I suppose it's mostly a matter of finding a few people with a similar interest around a topic (Product Tank is around the product management and leadership for example).
Then you just organize a gathering at one of your companies, where one of you speaks about a topic or facilitates a talk and post it on Meetup+ Linkedin

In the case of the product tank, the community is already there, so my role as organizer is mostly to find a sponsor, a topic and speakers.
I mostly find sponsors from asking participants of the previous meetups.They will then do the needful with their company to book the space and most of the time some snacks and drinks to avoid hungry participants.
Topics, I usually discuss with the sponsor what is something that they would benefit to talk about. They usually have a few ideas that can be picked from.
As for the speakers, I have to rely on my network or my network's network. Usually someone knows someone else who would make a great speaker about a topic and more often than not, these people are happy to share some of their knowledge on stage.

## Final words

It can be a bit daunting at times to go to events, especially before or after a long workday, but I very rarely regretted participating as there is always something valuable to learn or someone interesting to meet.

I hope I got you excited to try to participate (more) into meetups, and if you are from the product community and not far from Helsinki, to give a try to the Product Tank Helsinki :) .
