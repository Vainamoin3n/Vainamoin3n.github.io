## Eficode

### Eficode Journey

- **Role:** Product Manager
- **Team:** 1 product manager, 1 engineering lead, 4 software engineers, 1 product designer
- **Users:** Eficode customers, Eficode employees


#### Summary
Eficode Journey is Eficode's customer portal. It was built from scratch by Eficode R&D for which I was the product manager
It enables transparency on Eficode's activity, ease of reporting and visibility on the state of software engineering, IT and Platform engineering at the customer's.

#### Outcomes
- Reporting went from "hours-days per month per customer" to "minutes per month per customer"
- Enabled a new product line - Eficode Advisory & Support
- 50-60% Monthly Active organizations in Managed Services customer base
- The customer trust in the Managed Services organization increased significantly after Eficode Journey was introduced

#### Capability timeline 
##### 1) Tickets SLA
- **Problem:** No systematic way to report the SLAs on tickets leading to time consuming operations and mistakes, or simply skipped
- **What we shipped:** Service Managers can now do the reports in 2 clicks and it automatically shares to the customer and sends them an email when they approve it.
- **Impact:** The effort dropped to almost null, reports became systematic across the whole customer base and mistakes were easily found and fixed.

##### 2) Uptime SLA
- **Problem:** The Uptime SLA (How well has Eficode kept the customer's tool available and working) was an incredibly time consuming reports to make and the data was unreliable in many cases, so the reports were mostly not made, unless requested, even though stated to be provided in the contract
- **What we shipped:** Service Managers can now do the reports in 2 clicks and highlight to the customers the issues and their reasons if such exist. The Monthly Maintenance Breaks and vulnerabilities updates are automatically removed from the % target.
- **Impact:** All the customer get their monthly reports in the portal. The usage of the feature dropped because customers know that we are doing looking at these reports actively and know where to find them.
