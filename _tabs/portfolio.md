### Eficode Journey

**Role:** Product Manager • 
**Users:** Eficode customers, Eficode employees

#### Summary
Eficode Journey is Eficode's customer portal. It was built from scratch by Eficode R&D for which I was the product manager
It enables transparency on Eficode's activity, ease of reporting and visibility on the state of software engineering, IT and Platform engineering at the customer's.

#### Outcomes
- Reporting went from "hours-days per month per customer" to "minutes per month per customer"
- Enabled a new product line - Eficode Advisory & Support
- 50-60% Monthly Active organizations in Managed Services customer base

#### Capability timeline (problem → capability → proof)
##### 1) Tickets SLA
- **Problem:** No systematic way to report the SLAs on tickets leading to time consuming operations and mistakes, or simply skipped
- **What we shipped:** Service Managers can now do the reports in 2 clicks and it automatically shares to the customer and sends them an email when they approve it.
- **Impact:** The effort dropped to almost null, reports became systematic across the whole customer base and mistakes were easily found and fixed.
