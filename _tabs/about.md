# A Product Manager in HEL

Hey, I'm Clément Louarn, 35 years old living in Finland nearby Helsinki.

Writing a blog is a thought I have had for a while but never considered that I could say something that would add to the community.
That is until Antti Suvanto, a colleague and mentor of mine told me: 
> Clément, writing is not about adding new things to the community. It's about sharing your unique perspective so that others may learn from it.

I won't pretend to write anything that hasn't been said yet, but at least it will come from my personal experience, discussions I've had with colleagues and books that I have read.

The topics will be mostly centered around working in a product company and my thoughts on Product Management, Agile, Company Culture, Organization and so on.

## Welcome to read my Product Musings :) !
